This assignment goal is to get know about your:

* technical skills in angular js and html overall
 
  * angular routing

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you start working on a test assignment you'll need to set up accounts.
Asana and HipChat requires an email invite, thus you need to request it from 
us by sending an email to hi@stateful.eu with your request.

Github
~~~~~~

* You'll need to create a github account if you dont have one
* Create a repository for ui project

We use Asana for a project management. You'll need to set up an account first.

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Workflow
--------

This is a replica of our company's workflow. You are expected to follow it during the project. 


Tools you should use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- As you may guessed: AngularJS (routing, directives, templating..)
- Selenium and protractor.js for acceptance tests
- Github as repo hosting for your project

Before you start working
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make a day plan:

- Create yourself a task for a dayplan in your personal asana project
- Place a list of tasks you're going to do
- Assign yourself a task

   - Make sure you understand it
   - Add estimate tag

Work on tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you start on task

   - Tag it with `#wip` (work in progress)
   - Do you work in a separate branch

When you finish the task

  - Make sure tests run correctly
  - Check browser/platform compat
  - Push your code to github
  - Make a pull request to a feature branch

     - Mention asana task url in PR message
     - If there's no feature branch - create one

  - Remove `#wip` tag

If you're in doubt or stuck shout about it into the hipchat as soon as possible. Ask if you dont understand something. Communication is the key to success.
